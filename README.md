- Your color scheme should open in separate pane
- As you put the cursor on different source elements, the other pane will find and display the XML element that is affecting this element
- If more than one style element affect the code element, the most relevant style match is displayed first and you can go to other matches with Ctrl+Alt+Right and Ctrl+Alt+Left
